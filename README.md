# Surfs_up
# Overview
We are doing analysis for a surf shop to be opened in Oahu. The analysis is based specifically on the temperatures in the month of June and December. 
This analysis is to see if it is feasiable to open a surf and icecream shop in Oahu and if it will be successful all year round.
# Results
We were provided with the database for the hawaii and in that we have information for the weather condition. Our main focus was on the temperatures in
in the month of June and December. With the query written and extracting data of the temperatures in both months we see:
* Temperature in June is more in the 70's range which is between 75-78 and up.
* Tempertaure in the month of December is more like in the range starting at 77 and then going down to 60's
* Mean for both months is in 70's range which is for June is 74 F and December is 71 F.

* The minimum temperature for June is 64 and for December is 56.
# Summary
According to my analysis I think the temperature data strongly supports the idea of opening icecream shop. The reason being pleasant weather
data. Even in the 60's temperature the icecream shop will still be a great success as the temperature are warm enough. For surfing I would want to 
get more data as temperature in 60's is still low temperature for surfing and water would tend to get cold with strong winds. 
For surfing I would like to query for three aspects:
* One for data for high tides as surfers can only surf with good amount of tides and what time of the year are they good enough and if it is for good 
  amount of months.
* Second aspect that I would like to get data on is rate of storms or no of storms. Storms will highly effect the surfing statistics.
* Third aspect that I would like to look at is the wind speed.  As surfing is best done when its wind free. Calm
  surface of water without gust of wind. If this area data suggests that its a high wind area then surfers choice to pick this area for surfing would
  be less likely as high winds break the surfing waves making it less fun.
  
  My analysis suggests that ice cream shop will be a good hit in the area because of the temperature. As far for surfing shop we need to analyze the data 
  more for high tides, storms and wind speed. Once we have this data we will be able to give a more better idea if surfer shop will be a success or not.
